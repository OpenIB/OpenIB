<a id="what-is-8chan"></a><h2>What is 8chan?</h2>
<p>8ch.net is a website running <a href="https://github.com/OpenIB/OpenIB" target="_blank">OpenIB</a> as a result of the 2017 April Fools' Day hack. OpenIB is a security-focused version of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/infinity">infinity</a>, an open-source software that allows anyone to create and manage their own anonymous imageboard without any programming or webhosting experience for free. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/infinity">infinity</a> is based on <a target="_blank" href="https://engine.vichan.net/">vichan</a> (pronounced sixchan), which in turn stems from an older, abandoned project called <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyboard.org/">Tinyboard</a>. </p>
<p align="right" style="font-size:0.7em"><a href="#top-faq">[Back to Index]</a></p>

<a id="what-is-an-imageboard"></a><h2>What is an imageboard?</h2>
<p>An imageboard lets you post text and images anonymously (without a name) about any topic - or no topic at all. Unlike forums, imageboards do not hold or store old content permanently and old threads are pruned as new ones are created.</p>

<p>The imageboard format has several advantages over traditional forums:</p>
<ul>
   <li>There is no registration process, which allows anyone to post what they like without having to jump through hoops;</li>
   <li>Users are not required to have names and, thus, feel no reason to build up an identity or reputation for themselves - posts are judged based on their content rather than who made them;</li>
   <li>Sharing images and multimedia content is as easy as saving and uploading it to the site.</li>
</ul>
<p align="right" style="font-size:0.7em"><a href="#top-faq">[Back to Index]</a></p>




<a id="how-is-8chan-run"></a><h2>How is 8chan run?</h2>
<p>8chan is a service that hosts a large selection of imageboards to browse. The individual boards that make up 8chan are maintained by their respective owners, who are not affiliated with the 8chan administration.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://8ch.net/glovols.html">8chan global staff</a> maintains and improves the site and protects it from illegal content and spam. The 8chan administration does not enforce any rules other than the <a target="_blank" href="https://8ch.net/globalrule.html">8chan global rule</a>. Any complaints about the content, management, or moderation of a board should be addressed to the owner of said board, unless it violates the laws of the United States of America - because that is where the servers are located - or 8chan's <a target="_blank" href="https://8ch.net/dost.html">global policy</a>.</p>

<a id="how-do-i-create-a-new-thread"></a><h2>How do I create a new thread?</h2>
<p>
Navigate to the board you would like to post on, fill out the post form, and click on <i>New Thread</i>. On most boards, you are required to upload an image, but, if you do not have one, you can also draw a picture by using the oekaki applet (<i>[Show post options & limits]</i> > <i>Show oekaki applet</i>). No board requires you to provide a name or email address.
</p>
<p><img src='static/how_to_make_a_thread.png'></p>

<p>By clicking on <i>[Show post options & limits]</i>, you can also choose a flag (if available on the board where you want to post), embed video links, choose not to bump, and spoiler images.</p>
<p align="right" style="font-size:0.7em"><a href="#top-faq">[Back to Index]</a></p>



<a id="how-do-i-reply-to-a-thread"></a><h2>How do I reply to a thread?</h2>

<p>On 8chan, threads are ordered from newest (top) to oldest (bottom), while replies are ordered from oldest (top) to newest (bottom).  
To reply to a thread, click on <i>[Reply]</i> on any thread on a board's index page or, from a board's catalog, click on any thread tile.</p>
<p><img src='static/how_to_reply.png'></p>

<p>Enter your reply in the <i>Comment</i> field. Once it is posted, your reply will be highlighted in the thread.</p>
<p align="right" style="font-size:0.7em"><a href="#top-faq">[Back to Index]</a></p>



<a id="how-do-i-reply-to-another-poster"></a><h2>How do I reply to another poster?</h2>
<p>Click on the number of the post you wish to reply to. A Quick Reply box will pop up automatically, prepopulated with the post number you are replying to. Enter your reply under the post number and click on <i>New Reply</i>. When someone replies to you, you will see <i>(You)</i> after the post number as a hint.</p>

<p><center><img src='static/replying_to_someone.png'></center></p>

<p>If you wish to delete a post you made or an image you posted, you can do so by clicking on the triangle on the left side of your post. Board owners may disable self-deletion, so it might not always be an option.</p>

<p>You can also report, hide, or filter other posts by clicking on the triangle.</p>

<a id="are-there-any-global-rules-regarding-content"></a><h2>Are there any global rules regarding content?</h2>
<p>Only one:</p>

<p><b>Do not post, request, or link to any content that is illegal in the United States of America and do not create boards with the sole purpose of posting or spreading such content.</b></p>

<p>Other than that, you are free to make whatever rules you want on your board.</p>

<a id="what-is-a-tripcode"></a><h2>What is a tripcode?</h2>
<p>Most posts on 8chan are made anonymously, but this is not the only way to post. The <i>Name</i> field can be used to establish identity as follows: </p> 

<ol>
	<li>By simply entering a name in the <i>Name</i> field. This is not secure, since any other poster is able to use the same name;</li>
	<li>By entering one # character and a password in the <i>Name</i> field. Adding #example to the <i>Name</i> field would generate !KtW6XcghiY. This is reasonably secure - however, with increasing GPU speeds, these tripcodes may be cracked in a few days by a dedicated attacker;</li>
	<li>By entering two # characters and a password in the <i>Name</i> field. Adding ##example to the <i>Name</i> field would generate !!Dz.MSNRw9M. This is quite secure, but it relies on a secret salt on the server. This means the code will not work on websites other than 8chan;</li>
	<li>Board owners and volunteers may capcode by entering <i>## Board Owner</i> or <i>## Board Volunteer</i> in the <i>Name</i> field, depending on their respective positions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note: on 8chan, <b>board owners</b> may disable the <i>Name</i> field by clicking on <i>Settings</i> and checking the <i>Forced anonymous</i> box. Additionally, <b>users</b> are able to anonymize all posts on any 8chan board by clicking on <i>[Options]</i> (top-right corner) and checking the <i>Forced anonymity</i> box under <i>General</i>. This is because many users (including board owners) <b>do not like</b> people using tripcodes if there is no proper reason for it.</p>

<a id="what-is-alacrity"></a><h2>What is Alacrity?</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://alacrity.sh/">Alacrity</a>, also known as the Alacrity daemon, is an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cipherwraith/alacrity">open-source</a> caching layer and write buffer workaround created by the 8chan Administrator to alleviate the resource-intensive hard-disk write bottleneck issues 8chan was suffering from in late 2015 and early 2016.</p>
<p>Alacrity is composed of four scalable servers (one master and three slaves). Each server contains multiple nodes and others may be added on demand (for instance, if there is a sudden influx of users). Whenever a node crashes, some threads on the website start displaying 404 despite not being deleted yet.</p>
<p align="right" style="font-size:0.7em"><a href="#top-faq">[Back to Index]</a></p>

<a id="thread-has-been-deleted-but-still-able-open-it-why-is-this"></a> 

<h2>A thread has been deleted but I'm still able to open it. Why is this?</h2>
<p>The thread is deleted but still visible cached because of the way Alacrity works. The thread will properly show 404 in a matter of time, whenever Alacrity catches up. Read the <a href="#what-is-alacrity"><i>What is Alacrity?</i></a> entry if you want to know more.</p>

<a id="a-thread-404d-out-of-nowhere-but-is-not-deleted-how-do-i-fix-it"></a>

<h2>A thread 404'd out of nowhere, but it is not deleted. How do I fix it?</h2>

<p>When an Alacrity node crashes, threads and board index pages that were not written to the 8chan hard disk will generate a blank page and result in a 404 page. A node may crash when Alacrity is improperly or incorrectly restarted after bugs are fixed or upgrades are implemented (usually, once a day). If Alacrity is not restarted, nodes remain functional indefinitely.</p>

<p>Some time ago, we found that board volunteers could fix threads themselves by using <i>mod.php?</i> and simply making any kind of post in the affected thread. If you are not a volunteer, but you still want to fix a thread, you can do so by using a public account to log in and posting in the broken thread to fix it as previously mentioned. The public account's username is <i>Anyone</i> and the password is <i>0</i>. After logging in, add <i>mod.php?</i> to the URL of the affected thread (like this, <i>8ch.net/mod.php?/exampleboard/res/1111.html</i>). Then, post in the thread. This should fix the thread for every user. On most boards, you can delete your own post afterwards. If a large amount of threads are broken on a board, please send an email to <a href="mailto:admin@8ch.net" target="_blank">admin@8ch.net</a> or create a thread on <a href="https://8ch.net/sudo/catalog.html" target="_blank">/sudo/</a>.</p>

<a id="is-there-a-way-to-tell-if-im-banned"></a><h2>Is there a way to tell if I am banned?</h2>
<p>8chan has no ban check page at this moment, but we are working on one. To see if you are banned, you must try to post on a board - a ban page will be displayed if you are. Since boards are managed individually, being banned from one board does not necessarily mean you are banned from others. Only global volunteers are able to ban you from all boards and <b>only if you break the <a target="_blank" href="https://8ch.net/globalrule.html">8chan global rule</a></b>.</p>

If your VPN has been banned, a ban message will be displayed and you may appeal the ban.</p>

<p>If you receive infinite captchas without being able to post after switching to a VPN, restart your browser and try again. If it still does not work, explain your situation on <a target="_blank" href="https://8ch.net/sudo/catalog.html">/sudo/</a>.</p>  

<p>If you are getting infinite captchas without using a VPN, the error may be Cloudflare-related. Again, post about it on <a href="https://8ch.net/sudo/catalog.html" target="_blank">/sudo/</a>.</p>

<p>Likely not. If you are banned, you should see a ban page telling you that you are.</p>
<p>If you get an error, something went wrong. You can report the error you are getting on <a href="https://8ch.net/sudo/catalog.html" target="_blank">/sudo/</a> if you are able to post there. Otherwise, send an email to &lt;admin@8ch.net&gt;.</p>

<a id="help-my-board-has-been-deleted"></a><h2>Help! My board has been deleted!</h2>
<p>As of November 13th, 2014, board expiration no longer occurs automatically.</p>
<p>A board only gets deleted by the 8chan administration if the board is found to have been allowing and / or storing child pornography, per the <a target="_blank" href="https://8ch.net/globalrule.html">8chan global rule</a>.</p>  
<p>Alternatively, at the discretion of the 8chan administration, the board in question may be forced into becoming a textboard instead to remove all law-breaking images.</p>

<a id="i-lost-ownership-of-my-board-what-happened"></a><h2>I lost ownership of my board. What happened?</h2>
<p>You may lose access to your board if you fail to log in for two weeks. Furthermore, you may lose access to your board if it is reassigned as a result of noncompliance with one of the conditions for board reassignment.</p>

<p><b>If the board owner is not doing anything illegal, the 8chan administration cannot and will not help you.</b> The 8chan administration does not dictate how board owners or volunteers should manage their boards.</p>

<p>However, a few conditions must be met:</p>

<ol>
	<li> The board owner must not allow illegal content to be posted on his or her board;</li> 
	<li> The board owner must not state in his or her board's rules that the 8chan global rule does not apply;</li>  
	<li> The board owner must not blanket-ban large swaths of IP ranges;</li>
	<li> The board owner must not make it impossible to post on his or her board, either by locking all or most threads and / or deleting all or most threads or posts;</li>  
	<li> The board owner must not implement CSS that makes it impossible to post;</li>
	<li> The board owner must not squat in a board for the purpose of redirecting users from 8chan to a different website. <b>Please note:</b> creating a bunker in case of primary-website malfunction / downtime is fine, provided all of the above are complied with.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the board owner fails to comply with <b>any</b> of the above, you may report the board to the 8chan Administrator on <a target="_blank" href="https://8ch.net/sudo/">/sudo/</a>. The board will then be eligible for reassignment, at the discretion of the 8chan administration.</p>

<a id="can-i-have-a-list-of-all-api-endpoints-for-getting-raw-data-from-8chan"></a><h2>Can I have a list of all API endpoints for getting raw data from 8chan?</h2>

<p>Taking <a href="https://8ch.net/b/catalog.html" target="_blank">/b/</a> as an example, they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>https://8ch.net/b/index.rss - an RSS-formatted index so that you can watch smaller boards and get updates when they get new posts using a feed reader like Thunderbird or Feedly;</li>
	<li>https://8ch.net/b/0.json - an index of all threads on page 0 of /b/;</li>
	<li>https://8ch.net/b/res/1.json - all replies of thread 1 on /b/;</li>
	<li>https://8ch.net/b/threads.json - a thread index of all 15 pages of /b/.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also endpoints for getting information about 8chan's boards:</p>
<ul>
        <li>https://8ch.net/boards.json - boards on 8chan (warning, 1MB+);</li>
        <li>https://8ch.net/settings.php?board=b - board settings of /b/ (JSON format).</li>
</ul>
<p>Just read the data to get an idea of what is exposed and under what attribute names. It should be self-explanatory. Endpoints that are not listed here, like post.php, catalog.json or boards-top20.json are subject to change or removal at any time.</p>

<a id="what-is-the-8chan-nerve-center"></a> 

<h2>What is the 8chan Nerve Center?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://nerv.8ch.net" target="_blank">Nerve Center</a> is 8chan's overboard. It shows threads from all 8chan boards in catalog view. The <a href="https://nerv.8ch.net" target="_blank">Nerve Center</a> can display up to eight boards of your choosing by adding the board names to the URL. For example, <i>nerv.8ch.net/board1/board2/board3/boardetc</i>. You cannot create threads or moderate boards from the <a href="https://nerv.8ch.net" target="_blank">Nerve Center</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://nerv.8ch.net" target="_blank">Nerve Center</a>, each catalog tile has four capital letters: <b>R</b> (number of replies), <b>S</b> (speed), <b>M</b> (mass), and <b>E</b> (energy). Speed, mass, and energy are calculated as follows:

<code>
<p>
calculateSpeed :: Int -> POSIXTime -> Maybe Int -> Int<br>
calculateSpeed postCount now threadStart =<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  case threadStart of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Nothing -> 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Just st -> if postCount &lt; threadThreshold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      then 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      else round $! (fromIntegral postCount) / (fromIntegral $ ((round now :: Int) - st)) * 86400.0</p>
</code>
<hr>
<code>
<p>
calculateMass :: Maybe [Post] -> Int<br>
calculateMass Nothing = 0<br>
calculateMass (Just p) = calculateMass' p 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    calculateMass' [] i = i<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    calculateMass' (r:rs) i = calculateMass' rs (i + (calc r))<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    calc :: Post -> Int<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    calc x = case (_comment x) of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Nothing -> 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Just x' -> T.length x'</p>
</code>

<code>
<p>
calculateEnergy :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int<br>
calculateEnergy !v !m !p = round $!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ((0.5 * (fi m) * ((fi v) ^ 2)) / (fi p)) / 10000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    fi z<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      | z == 0 = fromIntegral 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      | otherwise = fromIntegral z</p>
